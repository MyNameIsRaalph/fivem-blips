HOW TO INSTALL

1. Upload the "blips" folder into your /server-data/resources folder
2. Add "start blips" into your server.cfg file

HOW TO CHANGE THE BLIP LOCATION

You can use /coords in your server to get your coordinates. You can then change the coords in your blips.lua file to match where you'd like the blip to be. 

{title="Example 1", colour=5, id=446, x = -347.291, y = -133.370, z = 38.009},

You can also change "Example 1" to anything you'd like. This name will be visible in game to other players, so make sure this is renamed accordingly. 

HOW TO CHANGE THE BLIP ICON / COLOUR

Please refer to the below link for all blips and colours.

Once you've found the blip icon you'd like, simply replace "id=X" with the blip number. Same applies for the colour too.
